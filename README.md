The Colour Clock Rebuild Angular Addition
========================

The original [Colour Clock](http://thecolourclock.co.uk/) is a brilliant idea by [Jack Hughes])(http://www.lookatjack.com/) representing time as a hexadecimal value.

The next iteration was also great using just jQuery and CSS3 [jQuery/CSS3 Colour Clock](www.joelpeterson.com/clock) updated by [Joel Peterson](http://joelpeterson.com)

This is a rebuild of The Colour Clock and adding it to a Angular Directive using Angular/CSS3.

## Make sure to check the index.html

For all you need to know is just include the colorClockAng and change over the ng-app if need be.
Then simply call the clock as such

    <color-clock></color-clock>
