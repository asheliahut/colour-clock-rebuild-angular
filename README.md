The Colour Clock Rebuild Angular Addition
========================

The original [Colour Clock](http://thecolourclock.co.uk/) is a brilliant idea by [Jack Hughes])(http://www.lookatjack.com/) representing time as a hexadecimal value.

The next iteration was also great using just jQuery and CSS3 [jQuery/CSS3 Colour Clock](www.joelpeterson.com/clock) updated by [Joel Peterson](http://joelpeterson.com)

This is a rebuild of The Colour Clock and adding it to a Angular Directive using jQuery/CSS3.
